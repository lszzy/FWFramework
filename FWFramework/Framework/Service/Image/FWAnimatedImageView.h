 @note If you are confused about this description, open Chrome browser to view some large GIF images with low network speed to see the animation behavior.
 @note The best practice to use incremental load is using `initWithAnimatedCoder:scale:` in `SDAnimatedImage` with animated coder which conform to `SDProgressiveImageCoder` as well. Then call incremental update and incremental decode method to produce the image.
 Default is YES. Set to NO to only render the static poster for incremental animated image.
